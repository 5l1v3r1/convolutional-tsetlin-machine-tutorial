# The Convolutional Tsetlin Machine (coming soon)
## Learning Behaviour
The below figure depicts training and test accuracy for the Convolutional Tsetlin Machine on MNIST, epoch-by-epoch, in a single run. 
![Figure 4](https://github.com/olegranmo/blob/blob/master/performance_by_epoch_MNIST.png)
Test accuracy peaks at 99.50% after 168 epochs and 99.51% after 327 epochs. Further, test accuracy climbs quickly in the first epochs, passing 99% already in epoch $2$ for MNIST. Training accuracy approaches 100%.
